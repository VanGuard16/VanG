      <section class="our-history">
        <h1>Our History</h1>
        <p>The Emmanuel Alayande University of Education, Model High School, Oyo is an offshoot of the St. Andrew’s College, Oyo (formerly a Grade II Teachers’ College established in 1896) which was upgraded to a College of Education Campus under the then Oyo State College of Education, Ila-Oragun in 1980. Thus, at various times, the College had been known as St. Andrew’s College of Education, Oyo, Oyo State College of Education, Oyo and now Emmanuel Alayande College of Education, Oyo in 2008 in memory of the renowned educationist and an Andrian, Rev. Canon Emmanuel Alayande without affecting the core mandate as stipulated in the College Enabling Law.
          <br> <br>
          It is worthy of mentioning that, the College, since its relocation to the present site, has grown in leaps and bounds through funding by the Oyo State Government and the Normal and Special Interventions by the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund).
          <br> <br> <br>
          The major purpose of the establishment of the College was to serve essentially as an academic centre for the production of highly qualified NCE teachers.  The transformation from a Teachers’ Grade II awarding Institution to a Nigeria Certificate in Education is an undeniable fact that the institution has been responding to the needs of society and time. As at today, the College has produced thousands of virile teachers and professionals in other fields of endeavour making useful contributions to nation-building.</p>
